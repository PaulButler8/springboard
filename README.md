Projects completed as part of Springboard's Data Science Intensive curriculum.

Capstone Projects
Determining if Marketing Leads Will Convert - Using logistic regression I developed a model to predict if marketing leads will convert with 90% accuracy. 
Self-Triage Classification using Random Forests - Using a limited set of symptoms I developed a model to help patients determine how quickly they may need to seek medical care based on a possible diagnosis.

Data Wrangling
Practice cleaning messy data using pandas, XML, JSON, raw text, and working with databases.
*JSON Based Data Exercise
*API Mini-Project
*SQL Mini-Project

Inferential Statistics
This unit explores three different types of statistical inference and examines their similarities and differences through hands-on work and tutorials.
Human Body Temperature - hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance
Examining Racial Discrimination â€“ using Bootstrap inference. 
Reducing Hospital Readmissions - using Bayesian inference.

Machine Learning
Projects in this unit cover core machine learning (ML) techniques. It explores supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and best practices for applying machine learning. The curriculum in this unit represents a balance between technical rigor and practical applications with the ML techniques that are most widely used today.  
Boston House Pricing - predicting housing prices in Boston using linear regression.
Heights and Weights - using logistic regression to classify gender.
Predicting Movie Ratings - use Naive Bayes algorithm to accurately predict movie ratings based on their reviews.
Customer Segmentation - employ k-means clustering and associated accuracy metrics to partitioning problems.
